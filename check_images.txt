4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three model classifies the dog, not-a-dog and dog's breed correctly. So using only the uploaded 4 images, no one is better than other in term of accuracy. But the rounded total runtime with Alexnet, Resnet and VGG models are respectively 0, 1 and 3 sec. As AlexNet is the fastest, I feel AlexNet is the best to use in this case.
